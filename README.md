# BoilerPlate Code

This is very useful boilerplate code and can be used as a basis for building React apps.&nbsp; This is the stripped down version of an app named Indecision-App.   

###Getting Started 

To get things moving, copy the file using Clone/download in github.&nbsp; In your bash window do a git clone and paste the copied link to the repo.


###Installing: Once it is cloned to the local machine, open in a text editor.
 

    yarn install



###Running the program

    yarn run dev-server



###Deployment

To check if its working properly, the text inside the component from app.js should be rendered on the screen. &nbsp; It should say 'This is my boilerplate'

If you see this message, congratulations the boilerplate is working properly!  

Built With:

React.JS
